### what is fluke?
Fluke is a simple (but not extremely barebones) window manager for X which uses XCB for efficient asynchronous IO. Fluke is designed to be configured through source (รก la dwm).

### rationale
I wanted a very minimal window manager that suited my workflow, had good hotplug multimonitor support and was written in something a little bit less cryptic than C. I never really found what I was looking for in other window managers and decided to give it a try myself.

### features
> The planned features list is by no means exhaustive, it's just what I have managed to think of right now (open to suggestions).

#### current
- keybindings
- window centering
- window resizing & moving
- tiling (on-demand with keybinding)
- directional focusing, next/prev focusing, mouse focusing
- adopt orphaned windows (allows you to restart flukewm in place)
- configurable gutters to reserve space for status bars
- configurable window gaps & borders

#### planned/ideas
- fullscreen windows
- window snapping
- workspaces & scratchpads
- _basic_ EWMH support for docks, notifications, respectful closing of windows etc.
- monitor hotplug support

### prerequisites
- any c++17 compliant compiler should work (tested with clang-9)
- libraries/headers:
	- `xcb`
	- `xcb-util`
	- `xcb-randr`
	- `xcb-icccm`
	- `xcb-ewmh`
	- `xcb-keysyms`
	- `X11` (for key symbols)

### build & run
- run `make` or `make debug=no symbols=no` for debug and release build respectively (uses gcc by default)
- binary will be placed at `build/fluke`
- note: fluke will not run if another window manager is currently active
